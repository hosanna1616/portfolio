                        <h3>High school</h3>
                        <p>During my time at a Catholic high school, I was immersed in an environment that emphasized not only academic excellence but also moral and ethical development. The school’s commitment to fostering a sense of community and service played a significant role in shaping my character and work ethic. The curriculum was designed to encourage critical thinking, collaboration, and respect for diverse perspectives, which are essential skills in any professional setting.One of the pivotal moments in my high school journey was enrolling in an introductory course on HTML and CSS. This course provided me with foundational knowledge of web development, teaching me how to create structured content using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and style it effectively with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Learning these languages was not just about coding; it was about understanding the principles of design, user experience, and accessibility.</p>
